Relationship-aware semantics: to-one relationships are now queryable end to end, and every metadata surface advertises them.

**Querying (`@hypequery/datasets`, `@hypequery/clickhouse`):** dataset and metric queries can select, filter, and order by to-one related fields one hop deep (`dimensions: ['customer.country']`). Traversal executes as a ClickHouse `LEFT ANY JOIN` (new `leftAnyJoin` query-builder method), so base rows survive, duplicate target join keys can never fan out aggregates, and production matches the in-memory backend's first-match semantics. When runtime tenancy is active, joined targets with a `tenantKey` are scoped inside the join condition. `hasMany` remains metadata-only, and result row types include qualified fields (`row['customer.country']` is typed).

**Metadata:** the catalog and semantic contract expose `queryable` and `fields` per relationship (replacing `execution: 'metadata_only'`; `SEMANTIC_CONTRACT_VERSION` is now 2). Generated agent tools, Serve's Zod/OpenAPI input schemas, and MCP `get_dataset_schema` all advertise the same qualified field names the validators accept — including for config-shaped datasets in MCP. Serve no longer advertises dimensions as filterable when a dataset explicitly declares `filters: {}`.

**Validation:** `dataset()` now rejects relationship names that match the dataset's source table (the join alias would shadow the base table) or contain dots — both configurations previously failed confusingly at query time.

**Deprecations (no removals, no behavior changes):** the plan/backend execution path is frozen in favor of `createDatasetClient({ queryBuilder })`. `createBackend`, the `backend` client option, `createInMemoryBackend`, and the `PlanNode`/`SemanticBackend` protocol exports are `@deprecated` and receive bug fixes only.
