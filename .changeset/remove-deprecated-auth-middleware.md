Implement auth guard enhancements with type-safe authorization. Add `createAuthSystem` for compile-time role/scope safety, shared authorization validators (`checkRoleAuthorization`, `checkScopeAuthorization`), comprehensive integration tests, and OpenAPI documentation for auth requirements. Remove deprecated middleware functions in favor of the declarative guard API.
