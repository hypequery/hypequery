# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add authenticated dataset and measure-backed metric HTTP endpoints with role,
  scope, tenant, and page-size policy; support synchronous and asynchronous clients.
- Add accurate over-fetch pagination without changing ordinary client executions.
- Return public operational metadata separately from authorized, audited, redacted
  SQL diagnostics. Semantic measures use strings on the HTTP wire, matching
  TypeScript; local client result values retain their native types.
- Propagate disconnect and handler cancellation to execution; optionally emit
  validated, metadata-only RFC 0011 success and failure events.
- Add bounded logical discovery and an application factory with docs and OpenAPI
  disabled by default. Development documentation requires explicit opt-in.
- Run shared semantic HTTP fixtures in Python and TypeScript CI, including the
  FastAPI floor. ASGI production configuration remains PYD-06 work.
