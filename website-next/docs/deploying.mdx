# Deployment Overview

Serve turns query definitions into reusable HTTP handlers, docs, and tooling. This page explains how the runtime is structured so you can choose the right delivery mode for your app.

## One Definition, Many Runtimes

When you call `initServe` (or `defineServe`) you get back an `api` object. That object is environment-agnostic:

- `api.route('/hello', api.queries.hello)` registers an endpoint description
- `api.handler` exposes a Fetch-style request handler
- `api.start()` (and the CLI) boot a Node HTTP server
- `api.run('hello')` executes the same logic in-process

Because all of those methods share the same metadata and resolvers, you can move between deployment models without rewriting queries.

## Delivery Modes

| Mode | How it works | When to choose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standalone server** | `npx hypequery dev api/queries.ts` (or `serve`) wraps `api.start()` to run a Node HTTP server, host docs, and emit OpenAPI. | Quick local previews, dedicated analytics services (Render, Fly, Railway, Docker). |
| **Embedded framework handler** | Import the same `api` into Next.js, Remix, Express, Fastify, SST, etc. and wire up the provided handler/route helpers. | You already have an HTTP server and want the analytics endpoints to live beside existing routes. |
| **Edge/Fetch runtimes** | Use `api.handler` (Fetch interface) or `createFetchHandler(api)` to deploy on Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers, or Service Workers. | Need low-latency, edge-hosted analytics or want to avoid Node entirely. |
| **In-process execution** | Call `api.run(key)` / `api.execute` directly—no HTTP involved. | Cron jobs, SSR, background workers, or AI agents that just need the data. |

## Standalone Server (CLI & Node Helper)

<CodeBlock>
<Pre>
```bash
# Dev mode: watches files, hot reloads docs
npx hypequery dev analytics/queries.ts --port 4000

# Production mode: no watcher, same server
npx hypequery serve analytics/queries.ts --port 8080
```
</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

Both commands internally call `api.start({ port })` and add nicities (file watching, pretty logs, docs hosting). You can do the same in code:

<CodeBlock>
<Pre>
```typescript
import { api } from './analytics/queries';

const server = await api.start({ port: 4000 });
// later: await server.stop();
```
</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

## Embedding in Frameworks

Because every query is already a handler, you can mount the runtime anywhere:

<CodeBlock>
<Pre>
```typescript
// Next.js App Router example (app/api/weekly-revenue/route.ts)
import { api } from '@/analytics/queries';

export const POST = api.route('/weeklyRevenue', api.queries.weeklyRevenue).handler;
```
</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

Need more control? Use the adapters directly:

<CodeBlock>
<Pre>
```typescript
import { createNodeHandler } from '@hypequery/serve/node';
import { api } from './analytics/queries';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use('/api/analytics', createNodeHandler(api.handler));
```
</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

Edge runtimes can reuse the Fetch handler:

<CodeBlock>
<Pre>
```typescript
// Cloudflare Worker
import { api } from './analytics/queries';

export default {
  fetch(request: Request) {
    return api.handler(request);
  },
};
```
</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

## Docs and OpenAPI Everywhere

Whether you run the CLI server or embed handlers yourself, you can still render docs/OpenAPI:

- `api.docsHtml()` / `buildDocsHtml()` to serve the Redoc UI wherever you want
- `api.openapi()` / `buildOpenApiDocument()` to emit specs for schema registries

The CLI defaults to `/docs` and `/openapi.json`, but you can host the same assets under any route.

## Choosing a Path

1. **Need a quick API** → run `hypequery dev` and deploy that server directly.
2. **Have an existing server** → import `api` and mount the provided handlers.
3. **Doing serverless/edge** → use the Fetch adapter for your platform.
4. **No HTTP required** → call `api.run()` from the environments you already control.
