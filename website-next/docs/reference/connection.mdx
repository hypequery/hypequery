# Connecting to ClickHouse

hypequery provides a robust and type-safe way to connect to ClickHouse databases from Node.js runtimes, with intelligent client selection and comprehensive type safety.

Run `npx hypequery init` to scaffold your ClickHouse connection, env variables, and schema generation so you can skip the manual setup steps below.

## Connection Setup

For Node.js environments, hypequery automatically uses the Node.js ClickHouse client:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript
import { createQueryBuilder } from '@hypequery/clickhouse';

const db = createQueryBuilder({
  host: 'http://localhost:8123',
  username: 'default',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'my_database'
});
```
</CodeBlock>

**Client Selection:**
- Automatically uses `@clickhouse/client` (Node.js client)

**Requirements:**
- Must be running in a Node.js environment
- Requires `@clickhouse/client` to be installed


## Connection Options

hypequery supports all connection options provided by the official ClickHouse JavaScript client with full type safety:

### Core Connection Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `host` | `string` | The URL of the ClickHouse server, including protocol and port | Required |
| `username` | `string` | Username for authentication | 'default' |
| `password` | `string` | Password for authentication | undefined |
| `database` | `string` | The database to connect to | 'default' |


### Advanced Options

| `request_timeout` | `number` | Request timeout in milliseconds |
| `compression` | `{ response?: boolean; request?: boolean }` | Enable compression for requests and/or responses |
| `application` | `string` | Application name to identify in ClickHouse server logs |
