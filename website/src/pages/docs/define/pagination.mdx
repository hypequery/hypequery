# Pagination (removed)

> This feature has been removed from `@hypequery/clickhouse` while we revisit the design. The API surface documented previously (`paginate`, `firstPage`, `iteratePages`, and the related pagination result types) is no longer available in the current release. Use traditional limit/offset flows or build a custom cursor implementation outside the query builder if you need pagination semantics today.

We will re-document pagination once a production-ready version lands.
