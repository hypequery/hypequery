# Subqueries & CTEs

HypeQuery provides support for Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and raw SQL capabilities that allow you to create complex queries with subqueries.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are temporary result sets that you can reference within a query. They help make complex queries more readable and maintainable.

### Using QueryBuilder as a CTE

You can use another QueryBuilder instance as a CTE:

```typescript
import { createQueryBuilder } from '@hypequery/core';

const builder = createQueryBuilder(schema);

// Create a subquery builder
const activeUsersSubquery = builder
  .table('users')
  .select(['id', 'user_name', 'email'])
  .where('status', 'eq', 'active');

// Use it as a CTE in the main query
const results = await builder
  .table('orders')
  .withCTE('active_users', activeUsersSubquery)
  .select([
    'orders.id', 
    'orders.total', 
    'active_users.user_name'
  ])
  .innerJoin('active_users', 'user_id', 'active_users.id')
  .execute();
```

This will generate SQL similar to:

```sql
WITH active_users AS (
  SELECT id, user_name, email 
  FROM users 
  WHERE status = 'active'
) 
SELECT orders.id, orders.total, active_users.user_name 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN active_users ON orders.user_id = active_users.id
```

### Using Raw SQL as a CTE

For more complex subqueries, you can use raw SQL strings:

```typescript
const results = await builder
  .table('orders')
  .withCTE(
    'monthly_totals',
    'SELECT user_id, toStartOfMonth(created_at) as month, SUM(total) as monthly_sum FROM orders GROUP BY user_id, month'
  )
  .select([
    'orders.id',
    'orders.created_at',
    'monthly_totals.monthly_sum'
  ])
  .innerJoin('monthly_totals', 'user_id', 'monthly_totals.user_id')
  .where('orders.created_at', 'gte', 'monthly_totals.month')
  .execute();
```

### Multiple CTEs

You can chain multiple CTEs for complex analytics:

```typescript
const results = await builder
  .table('events')
  .withCTE(
    'daily_users',
    'SELECT user_id, toDate(timestamp) as day, COUNT(*) as event_count FROM events GROUP BY user_id, day'
  )
  .withCTE(
    'active_users',
    'SELECT user_id, COUNT(DISTINCT day) as active_days FROM daily_users GROUP BY user_id HAVING active_days > 7'
  )
  .select(['events.*'])
  .innerJoin('active_users', 'user_id', 'active_users.user_id')
  .execute();
```

## Raw SQL Expressions

For complex conditions that can't be expressed using the fluent API, you can use raw SQL expressions:

### HAVING Clauses

The `raw()` method allows you to add custom conditions to the HAVING clause:

```typescript
const results = await builder
  .table('orders')
  .select(['user_id'])
  .sum('total', 'total_spent')
  .groupBy(['user_id'])
  .raw('SUM(total) > 1000')
  .raw('COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) >= 3')
  .execute();
```

This will generate:

```sql
SELECT user_id, SUM(total) AS total_spent 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY user_id 
HAVING SUM(total) > 1000 AND COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) >= 3
```

## Limitations and Workarounds

HypeQuery doesn't directly support nested subqueries in WHERE clauses, but you can work around this with CTEs or raw SQL expressions:

### Example: IN Subqueries

To achieve a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category_id IN (SELECT id FROM categories WHERE active = 1)
```

Use a CTE approach:

```typescript
// Create a CTE for active categories
const results = await builder
  .table('products')
  .withCTE(
    'active_categories',
    'SELECT id FROM categories WHERE active = 1'
  )
  .select(['products.*'])
  .innerJoin('active_categories', 'category_id', 'active_categories.id')
  .execute();
```

### Example: Correlated Subqueries

For more complex scenarios like correlated subqueries, you may need to use your database client directly:

```typescript
import { ClickHouseConnection } from '@hypequery/clickhouse';

// For complex queries that HypeQuery can't easily build
const client = ClickHouseConnection.getClient();
const result = await client.query({
  query: `
    SELECT 
      u.id as user_id,
      u.user_name,
      (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM orders o
        WHERE o.user_id = u.id AND o.status = 'completed'
      ) as completed_orders
    FROM users u
    WHERE u.status = 'active'
  `,
  format: 'JSONEachRow'
});

const data = await result.json();
```

## Use Cases

### Analytics Queries

CTEs are particularly useful for analytics queries:

```typescript
const results = await builder
  .table('events')
  .withCTE(
    'daily_stats',
    'SELECT toDate(timestamp) as day, COUNT(*) as events, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users FROM events GROUP BY day'
  )
  .withCTE(
    'weekly_stats',
    'SELECT toStartOfWeek(day) as week, SUM(events) as events, SUM(users) as users FROM daily_stats GROUP BY week'
  )
  .select(['week', 'events', 'users'])
  .from('weekly_stats')
  .orderBy('week', 'DESC')
  .limit(10)
  .execute();
```

### Hierarchical Data

For hierarchical data or recursive queries, use a raw SQL approach with CTEs:

```typescript
const client = ClickHouseConnection.getClient();
const result = await client.query({
  query: `
    WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
      SELECT id, parent_id, name, 1 as level
      FROM categories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT c.id, c.parent_id, c.name, ct.level + 1
      FROM categories c
      INNER JOIN category_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
    )
    SELECT * FROM category_tree ORDER BY level, name
  `,
  format: 'JSONEachRow'
});

const data = await result.json();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use CTEs for readability**: Break complex queries into logical parts with CTEs.

2. **Optimize CTE reuse**: ClickHouse may materialize CTEs if used multiple times in a query.

3. **Consider performance**: Complex subqueries can impact performance; test with representative data volumes.

4. **Type safety**: When using raw SQL, you may lose type safety. Cast results appropriately.
