# Connecting to ClickHouse

Create a client and point it at your ClickHouse cluster. Keep credentials in
environment variables so you can rotate them safely.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@hypequery/clickhouse";

const db = createClient({
  host: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_HOST,
  username: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_USER,
  password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD,
  database: "analytics",
});
```

## Recommended setup

- Use a dedicated analytics user with least-privilege access.
- Configure connection pooling in your deployment environment.
