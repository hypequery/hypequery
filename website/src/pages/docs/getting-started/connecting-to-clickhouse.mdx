# Connecting to ClickHouse

Before you can run queries or generate types, hypequery needs credentials for your ClickHouse cluster. There are two ways to get up and running quickly.

## Option 1: Use `hypequery init`

The fastest route is to let the CLI scaffold everything for you:

```bash
npx hypequery init
```

The init command will:

- Detect or prompt for your ClickHouse host, database, username, and password/token
- Create a `.env` file with the `CLICKHOUSE_*` variables hypequery expects
- Generate starter query files plus the `analytics/schema.ts` type definitions so you can start coding immediately

If you skipped this during onboarding, you can rerun the command anytime—existing files won’t be overwritten unless you confirm.

## Option 2: Wire up the connection manually

When you want to control the setup yourself, create a ClickHouse client in Node.js using the `@hypequery/clickhouse` package. hypequery automatically selects the Node driver and keeps everything type-safe:

```ts
import { createQueryBuilder } from '@hypequery/clickhouse';

export const db = createQueryBuilder({
  host: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_HOST!,
  username: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME ?? 'default',
  password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE ?? 'default',
});
```

Add the corresponding environment variables (or inline values) for your ClickHouse deployment:

```
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=https://example.clickhouse.cloud:8443
CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE=default
CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=default
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=super-secret
```
