# Overview

## What is hypequery?

hypequery is a code-first analytics layer for ClickHouse.

It lets you define queries in TypeScript, give them names, types, and schemas, and execute them anywhere they're needed: inside backend services, background jobs, APIs, dashboards, or AI agents.

Instead of scattering SQL across applications, dashboards, and scripts, hypequery gives you a single, versioned place where analytics logic lives. In code.

hypequery is a library, not a hosted platform. It integrates directly with your existing ClickHouse setup and runs wherever your application runs.

## Core primitives

hypequery provides a small set of opt-in building blocks:

- **Code-first metric and query definitions** — Define named analytics in TypeScript with explicit inputs, outputs, and metadata.

- **Type-safe query building for ClickHouse** — Compose queries programmatically without string-building SQL.

- **Embedded execution** — Run analytics directly in-process using `api.run()`. No HTTP required.

- **Optional HTTP & OpenAPI exposure** — Expose the same definitions as APIs when needed, with generated OpenAPI specs.

- **React hooks** — Generate TanStack Query hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) straight from your `serve.define` catalog for type-safe UI consumption.

Each primitive can be used independently. There is no required runtime, server, or hosted service.


## Use Cases

### Backend & platform teams

Define analytics once and reuse them across services, cron jobs, background workers, and internal tools, without copying SQL or re-implementing logic.

### Dashboards

Expose a small, trusted set of metrics to dashboards instead of letting each chart redefine business logic.

### AI agents & automation

Give agents structured, discoverable analytics with typed inputs and outputs. Not raw SQL strings or brittle prompts.

### Data teams on ClickHouse

Keep ClickHouse fast and flexible while managing analytics logic in code, under version control, with clear ownership.

### Multi-tenancy SAAS apps

Query endpoints automatically generated with tenant context for analytical SAAS apps with data level security
