# Overview

## What is hypequery?

hypequery is a code-first analytics layer for ClickHouse.

It lets you define analytics logic, queries and metrics in TypeScript, give them names, types, and schemas, and execute them anywhere they're needed: inside backend services, background jobs, APIs, dashboards, or AI agents.

Instead of scattering SQL across applications, dashboards, and scripts, hypequery gives you a single, versioned place where analytics logic lives. In code.

hypequery is a library, not a hosted platform. It integrates directly with your existing ClickHouse setup and runs wherever your application runs.

## Core primitives

hypequery provides a small set of opt-in building blocks:

- **Code-first metric and query definitions** — Define named analytics in TypeScript with explicit inputs, outputs, and metadata.

- **Type-safe query building for ClickHouse** — Compose queries programmatically without string-building SQL.

- **Embedded execution** — Run analytics directly in-process using `api.run()`. No HTTP required.

- **Optional HTTP & OpenAPI exposure** — Expose the same definitions as APIs when needed, with generated OpenAPI specs.

- **Schemas, documentation, and discovery** — Metrics are typed, named, and introspectable, usable by both humans and machines.

- **ClickHouse-native by design** — Built specifically for ClickHouse performance characteristics and deployment models.


Each primitive can be used independently. There is no required runtime, server, or hosted service.


## Use Cases

### Backend & platform teams

Define analytics once and reuse them across services, cron jobs, background workers, and internal tools — without copying SQL or re-implementing logic.

### Internal dashboards

Expose a small, trusted set of metrics to dashboards instead of letting each chart redefine business logic.

### AI agents & automation

Give agents structured, discoverable analytics with typed inputs and outputs — not raw SQL strings or brittle prompts.

### Data teams on ClickHouse

Keep ClickHouse fast and flexible while managing analytics logic in code, under version control, with clear ownership.
