# Introduction

HypeQuery is a TypeScript SDK for building type-safe dashboards and analytics applications with ClickHouse.

## Why HypeQuery?

Working with ClickHouse in TypeScript applications has traditionally been challenging:

<ul>
  <li>Raw SQL strings lack type safety and IDE support</li>
  <li>Manual type definitions for queries and results are tedious to maintain</li>
  <li>Building interactive dashboards requires complex query management</li>
  <li>Processing large result sets efficiently is difficult</li>
</ul>

HypeQuery solves these problems by providing a fully type-safe query builder specifically designed for ClickHouse, with features tailored to building modern analytics applications.

## Key Features

### Complete Type Safety

Every part of your query is type-checked, from table and column names to filter values and result types. This provides:

<ul>
  <li>Autocomplete for table and column names</li>
  <li>Type validation for filter values</li>
  <li>Fully typed query results</li>
  <li>Compile-time error detection</li>
</ul>

### Flexible Join System

Easily create powerful joins with a fluent API:

<ul>
  <li>Type-safe join conditions</li>
  <li>Support for all join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS)</li>
  <li>Custom relationship definitions for more concise queries</li>
  <li>Smart table alias handling</li>
</ul>

### SQL Expressions & Functions

Use raw SQL expressions and ClickHouse functions when you need them:

<ul>
  <li>Incorporate ClickHouse-specific functions</li>
  <li>Mix builder methods with raw SQL when needed</li>
  <li>Type safety maintained through specialized helpers</li>
  <li>Support for complex expressions and subqueries</li>
</ul>

### Streaming Support

Process large result sets efficiently:

<ul>
  <li>Stream query results instead of loading everything into memory</li>
  <li>Handle millions of rows without performance issues</li>
  <li>Process data chunks in real time</li>
  <li>Built-in progress tracking</li>
</ul>

### Advanced Filtering

Build complex filtering logic:

<ul>
  <li>Cross-filtering between different queries</li>
  <li>Reusable filter definitions</li>
  <li>Support for complex conditions with AND/OR logic</li>
  <li>Date range filtering helpers</li>
</ul>

### Comprehensive Logging

Track query execution with detailed logs:

<ul>
  <li>Query text and parameters</li>
  <li>Execution time and row counts</li>
  <li>Structured logging format</li>
  <li>Query-specific subscription support</li>
</ul>
