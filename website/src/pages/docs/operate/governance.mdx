# Access & governance

Use this scaffold to capture how teams manage code owners, reviews, secrets, and rollout policies.

## Roles & permissions

Placeholder for describing which personas can merge metrics, ship APIs, or rotate credentials.

## Change management

Rough in the process for reviewing diffs, tagging releases, and auditing usage. Flesh it out later with concrete tooling references.
