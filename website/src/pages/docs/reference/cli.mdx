# CLI reference

List each CLI command (`init`, `serve`, `type`, etc.) with arguments, environment variables, and exit codes. Consider tables for clarity.

## Common commands

Add a placeholder table describing what each command does and when to run it.

## Examples

Reserve sections for copy-pastable snippets once content is ready.
