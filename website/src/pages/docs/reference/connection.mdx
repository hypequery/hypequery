# Connecting to ClickHouse

hypequery provides a robust and type-safe way to connect to ClickHouse databases from Node.js runtimes, with intelligent client selection and comprehensive type safety.

<Callout title="Tip: skip manual setup">
  Run `npx hypequery init` to scaffold your ClickHouse connection, env variables, and schema generation so you can skip the manual setup steps below.
</Callout>

## Connection Setup

For Node.js environments, hypequery automatically uses the Node.js ClickHouse client:

```typescript
import { createQueryBuilder } from '@hypequery/clickhouse';

const db = createQueryBuilder({
  host: 'http://localhost:8123',
  username: 'default',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'my_database'
});
```

**Client Selection:**
- Automatically uses `@clickhouse/client` (Node.js client)

**Requirements:**
- Must be running in a Node.js environment
- Requires `@clickhouse/client` to be installed


## Connection Options

hypequery supports all connection options provided by the official ClickHouse JavaScript client with full type safety:

| `username` | `string` | Username for authentication | 'default' |
| `password` | `string` | Password for authentication | undefined |
