# Connecting to ClickHouse

hypequery provides a robust and type-safe way to connect to ClickHouse databases. The library supports both Node.js and browser environments with intelligent client selection and comprehensive type safety.

## Connection Modes

hypequery supports two connection modes, each designed for specific environments:

### 1. Host-Based Connection (Auto-Detection) - For Node.js Environments

For Node.js environments, hypequery automatically uses the Node.js ClickHouse client:

```typescript
import { createQueryBuilder } from '@hypequery/clickhouse';

const db = createQueryBuilder({
  host: 'http://localhost:8123',
  username: 'default',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'my_database'
});
```

**Client Selection:**
- Automatically uses `@clickhouse/client` (Node.js client)

**Requirements:**
- Must be running in a Node.js environment
- Requires `@clickhouse/client` to be installed
- Cannot be used in browser environments

### 2. Manual Client Injection - For Browser Environments

For browser environments, you must explicitly provide a ClickHouse client instance:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@clickhouse/client-web';
import { createQueryBuilder } from '@hypequery/clickhouse';

const client = createClient({
  host: 'http://localhost:8123',
  username: 'default',
  password: 'password'
});

const db = createQueryBuilder({
  client // Explicitly provide the client
});
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be running in a browser environment
- Requires `@clickhouse/client-web` to be installed
- Client instance must be manually created and injected
- Cannot use auto-detection due to browser limitations


## Connection Options

hypequery supports all connection options provided by the official ClickHouse JavaScript client with full type safety:

### Core Connection Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `host` | `string` | The URL of the ClickHouse server, including protocol and port | Required |
| `username` | `string` | Username for authentication | 'default' |
| `password` | `string` | Password for authentication | undefined |
| `database` | `string` | The database to connect to | 'default' |


### Advanced Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `http_headers` | `Record<string, string>` | Custom HTTP headers to include with each request |
| `request_timeout` | `number` | Request timeout in milliseconds |
| `compression` | `{ response?: boolean; request?: boolean }` | Enable compression for requests and/or responses |
| `application` | `string` | Application name to identify in ClickHouse server logs |
| `keep_alive` | `{ enabled: boolean }` | Keep-alive connection settings |
| `log` | `any` | Logger configuration |
| `clickhouse_settings` | `ClickHouseSettings` | Additional ClickHouse-specific settings |
