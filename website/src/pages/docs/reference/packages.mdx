# Package Overview

hypequery ships a small set of focused packages. Use this page as a quick reference for which package solves which problem.

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@hypequery/serve` | Core runtime for authoring queries/metrics with `initServe`, exposing them via HTTP, and executing them in-process (cron, SSR, agents). Includes middleware, auth, OpenAPI/docs, and adapters. |
| `@hypequery/clickhouse` | Fluent, type-safe ClickHouse client used inside `ctx.db`. Exposes the query builder, expression helpers, caching utilities, and logging APIs you can also use standalone. |
| `@hypequery/cli` | Developer tooling (`hypequery init`, `hypequery dev`, `hypequery generate`, `hypequery create-api-types`). Handles scaffolding, schema introspection, and local docs. |
| [`@hypequery/react`](./react-package) | TanStack Query-powered hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) generated from your `serve.define` catalog so React apps can call metrics with full typing. |

## Typical project setup

Most apps depend on just three packages:

1. `@hypequery/serve` – define and expose metrics
2. `@hypequery/clickhouse` – run ClickHouse queries within those metrics
3. `@hypequery/cli` – drive the local dev server + schema/codegen tasks

Reach for `@hypequery/react` when you need hooks in UI code.
