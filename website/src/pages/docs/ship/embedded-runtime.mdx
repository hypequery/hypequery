# Embedded runtime

Use this area to document how `api.run` works, what the lifecycle looks like, and how to keep embedded execution safe.

## Lifecycle

Explain initialization, dependency injection, and hot reload expectations.

## Example flows

Add callouts for background jobs, cron tasks, or API handlers that execute metrics inline.
